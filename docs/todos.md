- [ ] Makefile
- [ ] Garbed collector?
- [ ] signals
- [ ] history
- [ ] one global variable for signal number


## Parts / main loop

- [ ] init
- [ ] Prompt
- [ ] Lexing
- [ ] Parsing
- [ ] expend symbols
- [ ] execution
- [ ] free


## parsing symbols
- [x] ''
- [x] "" with $
- [ ] <
- [ ] >
- [ ] <<
- [ ] >>
- [ ] |
- [ ] $
- [ ] $?



## execution
- [x] single cmd.
- [x] < redirect input.
- [x] > redirect output.
- [ ] << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the
delimiter is seen. However, it doesnâ€™t have to update the history!
- [x] >> should redirect output in append mode
- [x] | pipes


## built-ins
- [x] echo		with option -n
- [x] cd		with only a relative or absolute path
- [x] pwd		with no options
- [x] export	with no options
- [x] unset		with no options
- [x] env		with no options or arguments
- [x] exit		with no options




## Robin random
- [x] check out: readline
- [ ] main loop, test stuff out

- [ ] env _=/usr/bin/env  /minshell apsolut
- [ ] fix EXIT_FAILURE to correct exit number

- [ ] add $?

(export V=v | (echo $V && export U=u && echo $U) | cat -e) && echo $V
             (        --sub shell--           )

for something like that:
(echo im hear, meno && sleep 5 && echo hi) | (ping -c 2 1.1.1.1 && cat -e)


#### readline
read on line gets mallocte new line

#### rl_redisplay
Change what's displayed on the screen to reflect the current contents of rl_line_buffer.

Tell the update routines that we have moved onto a new (empty) line, usually after ouputting a newline.

#### rl_replace_line,
what it says
#### add_history, 
what it says
#### rl_clear_history, 
what it says
