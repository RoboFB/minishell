- [ ] Makefile
- [ ] Garbed collector?
- [ ] signals
- [ ] history
- [ ] one global variable for signal number


## Parts / main loop

- [ ] init
- [x] Prompt
- [x] Lexing
- [x] Parsing
- [ ] expend symbols
- [ ] execution
- [ ] free


## parsing symbols
- [x] ''
- [x] "" with $
- [x] <
- [x] >
- [ ] <<
- [x] >>
- [x] |
- [x] $
- [ ] $?

## parsing
- [ ] collect heredocs before execution
- [ ] expand when hitting each command
- [ ] set shell level
- [ ] accept redirect ahead of command



## execution
- [ ] single cmd.
- [ ] < redirect input.
- [ ] > redirect output.
- [ ] << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the
delimiter is seen. However, it doesnâ€™t have to update the history!
- [ ] >> should redirect output in append mode
- [ ] | pipes


## built-ins
- [ ] echo		with option -n
- [ ] cd		with only a relative or absolute path
- [ ] pwd		with no options
- [ ] export	with no options
- [ ] unset		with no options
- [ ] env		with no options or arguments
- [ ] exit		with no options




## Robin random
- [ ] check out: readline
- [ ] main loop, test stuff out

- [ ] env _=/usr/bin/env  /minshell apsolut
- [ ] fix EXIT_FAILURE to correct exit number



#### readline
read on line gets mallocte new line

#### rl_redisplay
Change what's displayed on the screen to reflect the current contents of rl_line_buffer.

#### rl_on_new_line
Tell the update routines that we have moved onto a new (empty) line, usually after ouputting a newline.

#### rl_replace_line,
what it says
#### add_history, 
what it says
#### rl_clear_history, 
what it says
