## Random
- [ ] Makefile
- [x] Garbed collector?
- [ ] signals
- [ ] history
- [ ] one global variable for signal number

## Parts / main loop
- [ ] init
- [x] Prompt
- [x] Lexing
- [x] Parsing
- [x] expand symbols
- [ ] execution
- [ ] free

## parsing symbols
- [x] ''
- [x] "" with $
- [x] <
- [x] >
- [ ] <<
- [x] >>
- [x] |
- [x] $
- [x] $?
- [x] $$
- [ ] *

## parsing
- [x] collect heredocs before execution
- [x] expand when hitting each command
- [x] << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the
delimiter is seen. However, it doesnâ€™t have to update the history!
- [ ] set shell level
- [x] accept redirect ahead of command
- [x] in cases like a""b, the current quote joiner turns the whole thing into a b, instead of ab. This is likely because I don't mark quotes as contained in a quote so after stripping there's no indicator of it having been in quotes.
- [ ] expansions on file redirects, check order and guard against multiple files. handle redirect expansions separately from arg expansions.
- [ ] attach redirect-only atoms to relevant expression.
- [x] export var="echo hi" && "$var" should error "echo hi: command not found"
- [ ] (mostly) ignore tokens and just read until next non alnum/_ char for variables. if no variable relevant (alnum/_) chars follow, $ should be treated as literal


## signals
- [ ] handle ctrl+c, ctrl+d && ctrl+\
- [ ] handle animation cues

## execution
- [x] single cmd.
- [x] < redirect input.
- [x] > redirect output.
- [x] >> should redirect output in append mode
- [x] | pipes

## built-ins
- [x] echo		with option -n
- [x] cd		with only a relative or absolute path
- [x] pwd		with no options
- [x] export	with no options
- [x] unset		with no options
- [x] env		with no options or arguments
- [x] exit		with no options




## Robin random
- [x] refactor run with no command.
- [x] shell level.
- [] no interctiv mode for testers. + testing
- [] * working dir an matching globla.
- [] somehow i redirect error to stdout and not stderror like: rhhhrhrhr > /dev/null

- [x] check out: readline
- [ ] main loop, test stuff out

- [x] env _=/usr/bin/env  /minshell apsolut -> ignore it
- [x] fix EXIT_FAILURE to correct exit number

- [x] add $?
- [x] Fix env varable like la li lu   of export la li lu (no =)

(export V=v | (echo $V && export U=u && echo $U) | cat -e) && echo $V
              (        --sub shell--           )

for something like that:
(echo im hear, meno && sleep 5 && echo hi) | (ping -c 2 1.1.1.1 && cat -e)

do we keep executing in this case:
(export testing="Makefile .gitignore" && echo bob > WTF < $testing) 2> /dev/null  || echo 2
result:
/dev/null: bash: $testing: ambiguous redirect
stdout: 2

cat < Makefile > 1 | cat < Makefile > 1




#### readline
read on line gets mallocte new line

#### rl_redisplay
Change what's displayed on the screen to reflect the current contents of rl_line_buffer.

#### rl_on_new_line
Tell the update routines that we have moved onto a new (empty) line, usually after ouputting a newline.

#### rl_replace_line,
what it says
#### add_history,
